The most confusing thing from Chapter 2 in ULSAH4 is without a doubt the section
about bash arrays. bash certainly doesn't set itself up to be a general purpose
programming language, but the sheer ugliness of array syntax is impressive. I
suppose there's a reason that "arrays in bash are a bit strange, and they're not
often used."

With that said, I'm glad the text clarified that all values in bash are really
just strings. When thought of in those terms, it makes some sense that integer
arithmetic and array indexing requires special syntax.
