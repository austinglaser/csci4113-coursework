# Homework 1

## Reading

Select one of the following resources to read in addition to the *material on
grep* and *bash globs and pattern matching* found in D2L.  The UNIX and Linux
System Administration Handbook, 4th Edition  (ULSAH4) is more in-depth and
detailed.  The CentOS Bible is more geared toward beginners.  The free reading
material is, well, free reading material.  Your mileage may vary.

- ULSAH4, Chapter 2, Section 2.2.  If you feel brave, try reading through 2.3
  (Regular Expressions).
- [The Linux Command Line Website: Writing
  Scripts](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_writing_shell_scripts.php&sa=D&ust=1472368865040000&usg=AFQjCNGhOHOowtCIiUxwiWkEQq2BINRLTw)...
  Stop when you get to #13.

## Exercises and Preparation

- Use your Google powers to find one command not listed on this weekâ€™s command
  reference or discussed in class.  Come to class prepared to briefly explain
  what the command does and why it is handy.  Submit this command and a short
  explanation in the D2L dropbox.
- Finish `vimtutor` as described in class. You need to edit the file
  `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3` and change `ONBOOT=yes`, then
  reboot the virtual machine (or at least *bounce* the interface) to connect
  to the internet. You then can install `vimtutor` (and `man` and any other
  *packages*) with the command:

    # yum install vim-enhanced man

Once installed, `vimtutor` can be launched with the command:

    $ vimtutor

## Submission Requirements

links these folders under Assesments->Dropbox.

1. Your muddiest point, or one item from the reading/study material that you
   found most confusing. Please submit as plain text in the dropbox itself.

Please submit the following in the Homework 1 discussion form on D2L under
